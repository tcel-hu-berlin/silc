## Simulations for Interactive Learning in Chemistry

### Credits
The design of this webpage was originally based on the Phantom by HTML5 UP template (info below), which has since been heavily modified. The simulations themselves were programmed by Natalia Spitha unless otherwise indicated. The activities were designed by Natalia Spitha and translated into German in consultation with Franziska Zimmer, Andrea Zehl, and Christian Kressman.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
